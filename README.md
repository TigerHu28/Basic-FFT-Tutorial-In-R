Introduction
Think about a time when you are posting your favorite pet pictures on Instagram, or watching your favorite Game of Thrones episode on HBO, or listening to your favorite song on Spotify, you are benefiting from an algorithm called FFT, the Fast Fourier Transform. Three major applications of FFT are frequency analysis, denoising/smoothing, and forecasting time series data. For every data scientist, it is not an exaggeration to say that FFT is a must-have tool that you would wish you had learned in school. But if you donâ€™t, this blogpost will be the perfect tutorial to get you started.
